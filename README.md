# OOPP (Object Oriented Programming Project)

Roguelike game developed in C++ using SDL2, as a project for the Object Oriented Programming course taken in year 2 at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest.

# Description

The game takes inspiration from titles such as The Legend of Zelda, or The Binding of Isaac: you are in a room, and in order to progress, you must defeat the enemies that you encounter. 

# Gameplay

You move with the WASD keys, and shoot with the arrow keys. You start off with 4 lives, and every time you get hit you lose one of them. If you run out of lives, you lose. Some enemies can drop additional lives when killed. You can also collect power ups, that modify your shots. At the end of the game, if you reach a highscore, it is saved in a Json file.
